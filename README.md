A few scripts that will enhance the use of motioneye on raspberry pi using GPIO sensors

send_overlay.pl

This script is designed for those using the waterproof outdoor temperature sensor DS18B20

It will detect the device, parse the temperature and display on the motioneye overlay (left frame). This will replace
the camera-name field.

Requirements:

Raspberry Pi Model A, B, B+ or Raspberry Pi 3
Pi Camera Board with cable (This should work with v2, but I have not tested it)
    https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/
DS18B20 Digital Waterproof temperature sensor
    https://www.adafruit.com/product/381
MotionEye software
    https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye
Rasbian or featured Linux os for your Raspberry Pi that supports 1 Wire Interface over GPIO
A working version of Perl installed

Software setup

    https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
    apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade ; apt-get dist-upgrade
Install and configure your 1 wire drivers
